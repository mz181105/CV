    <p class="autobiography">Hello, my name is Judy. thank you for take time to read my autobiography.
        About the reason why I want to be an engineer, is about self-actualization. 
        I'm always wandering the meaning of life.
         No one can live forever, but code can.
        I want to be an engineer that can solve problem and help people.<br>
        I worked at a small investment company for three years as a 
        administration staff.
        This job improved my excel skill, and let me realized the convenient of function.
        This is one of the reason that I want to be an engineer. To let custoner's life more convenient.
        constructing a web from zero is fun, even if I'm just a beginner. This web is my first work, 
        and it will be better after I learn more.<br>
        It will be a dream come true if I can enter AppWorks School to paratice and work with other elite classmates.
        But if unfortunately I'm not selected, I will keep learning by myself and try again.</p>
